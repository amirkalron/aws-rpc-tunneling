# Aws-rpc-tunneling: use AWS for tunneling your RPC calls


## What is it?
The common solution to enable RPC calls behind firewall\proxy is to use SSH tunneling.

##### What Are SSH  disadvantages?
- P2P architecture,not suitubale for common cloud multi machine architecture.
- needs some sophisticated configuration
- alsways open channel between nodes

This project uses a different approach - **polling via AWS SQS service**.

A tunnel object is created on the AWS platform,via SQS service,where producer\consumer push ans pull requests

#### Aadvantages:
- distributes,can be used by multiple slaves architecture
- very easy to configure
- platform indipendent,no need to configure SSH server\firewall settings

 
## How to start?

In **aws.properties**â€Ž file,set cridentials and proxy settings ( optional)

then,go to RestTunnelTest to view the example

Done!
